we're on ops.go

going to go with a operation-per-script model, the other paths are just too hard.

First step is fix the static void mess.
run fixstaticvoid
run u8param
run fixdecls
run sys_
run casts
u8 op2 = sys_rdb.*
just fix by hand to op2 := ...

fixed more casts

Now on to eliminating all the : ? stuff. 

added a simple set of functions: inc, dec, change
Fixed some repne stuff by hand
Multi line is a tad easier in emacs

ops.go is as far as I can get until I do prim_ops.go

But the register model is kinda fucked. Time to stop and redo it so registers have types and I don't have to do this
by hand any more. This was kinda stupid. Once you have a register you should only be able to do certain things
on it. My stupid bad.
